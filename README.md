# Web scraping using BeautifulSoup4 and requests
This project consists of two parts. The first part consists scrapping of a site consisting of [quotes](https://quotes.toscrape.com) while in the second part we scrape an [educational site](https://www.shiksha.com/mba/colleges/mba-colleges-india).
Below is a brief description of the libraries which have been used.
A screenshot of a part of the output obtained after scraping the first part of the web is also available in the repository.

## BeautifulSoup
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.  
It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.  
It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.  

## Requests
Requests allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the need for manual labor.   
Thereâ€™s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data.  
Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic.
